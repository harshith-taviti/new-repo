CalGPA is a web application designed to help students analyze and track their semester performance effectively, allows students to monitor their academic progress throughout the semester in real-time. A new feature on predictions that are based on neural networks is coming up soon. CalGPA delivers insights that help you improve your weaker subjects and get better in subjects you are good at.

## Features ‚ú®
- **GPA Calculator (Tracker.io)**: Tracker.io is a tool which focuses on bringing awareness in students that even a single mark can change their grade by minus one or even plus one. So by using this tool, students can now estimate their predicted GPA based on their inputs and then creating goals for the SEE and CIA Marks by filling the form inputs like no.of credits, CIA marks and predicted SEE marks.
